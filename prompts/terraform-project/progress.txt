# Terraform Kit — Progress

Source: prompts/terraform-project/prd.md

## Phase 1 — Kit Content

[x] 1.1 — CLAUDE.md project rules template — Completed 2026-01-30
      File: prompts/terraform-project/CLAUDE.md
      Source: prompts/cdk-project/CLAUDE.md
      Adapt all sections for Terraform (HCL, terraform CLI, tflint, validate).
      Use <PROFILE_NAME> placeholder. No version constraint.
      Prescribed directories: modules/, envs/<env>/, docs/, agents/.
      Include all 10 Terraform-specific defensive coding rules from PRD.
      Reference /test-terraform and /update-docs-terraform skills.
      Validate: every section in CDK CLAUDE.md has a Terraform equivalent.
      Validate: no CDK-specific terms remain (Jest, npm, TypeScript, cdk.json, lib/).
      Validate: no future/deferred content.

[x] 1.2 — test-terraform.md command — Completed 2026-01-30
      File: commands/test-terraform.md
      Source: commands/test-cdk.md
      Gate 1: git-secrets, terraform fmt -check, terraform init, terraform validate, tflint, tfsec/checkov.
      Gate 2: terraform plan -out=tfplan, terraform apply tfplan.
      Gate 3: update progress.txt, CHANGELOG.md, create feature doc, stage individually, commit locally.
      Sequential gates. Stop on failure. Same output format as test-cdk.
      Use <PROFILE_NAME> placeholder for AWS profile.
      Validate: gate structure matches PRD section 3.
      Validate: no CDK-specific terms remain.

[x] 1.3 — update-docs-terraform.md command — Completed 2026-01-30
      File: commands/update-docs-terraform.md
      Source: commands/update-docs.md
      Replace CDK data sources with Terraform equivalents per PRD mapping table.
      Data sources: variables.tf, locals.tf, terraform.tfvars, backend.tf, modules/.
      Documents refreshed: README.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.
      No docs/TESTING.md — validation covered in ARCHITECTURE.md.
      Validate: data source mapping matches PRD section 4.
      Validate: no CDK-specific data sources remain.

[x] 1.4 — CLAUDE_CODE_USER_GUIDE.md developer workflow guide — Completed 2026-01-30
      File: prompts/terraform-project/CLAUDE_CODE_USER_GUIDE.md
      Source: prompts/cdk-project/CLAUDE_CODE_USER_GUIDE.md
      Prerequisites: Terraform CLI, AWS CLI, tflint (optional), tfsec/checkov (optional).
      Skills table: /test-terraform, /update-docs-terraform, plus shared skills.
      Workflow steps adapted for Terraform.
      Session lifecycle unchanged.
      Project directories table: prescribed Terraform structure.
      Validate: all referenced skills exist (1.2 and 1.3 must be complete first).
      Validate: no CDK-specific terms remain.
      Validate: no future/deferred content.

## NOTES

- Process: Feature > Test > Complete > /compact > Next Feature
- Run /compact after every completed feature before starting the next one
- This is a content project — all deliverables are markdown
- "Test" means: review against PRD, verify no CDK leakage, confirm cross-references
- prd.md is the authoritative source for all requirements
- No runtime code. Quality = clarity + correctness.
